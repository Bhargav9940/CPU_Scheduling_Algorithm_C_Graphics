# CPU Scheduling Algorithm using C with Graphics
Implemented algorithms:
1.FCFS
2.SJF (Non-Preemptive)
3.SJF (Preemptive) (SRTN)
4.Priority (Non-Preemptive)
5.Priority (Preemptive)
6.Round Robin

### Note that File's extension is .cpp, although code is written in c only, it is cpp in order to use graphics in VS Code Editor.
